### Testing for Covid-19
Two kinds of tests are available for Covid-19: [Virus Tests](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html) and [Antibody Tests](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html).
- A viral test tells you if you have a current infection.
- An antibody test tells if if you had a previous infection.
An antibody test may not be able to show if you have a current infection, because it can take 1-3 weeks after infection to make antibodies. We do not know yet if having antibodies to the virus and prevent someone from getting infected again, or how long that protection might last.

### Who should be tested
To learn if you have a current infection, viral tests are used. But not everyone needs this test.
- Most people will have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care and may not need to be tested.
- CDC has [guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html) for who should be tested, but decisions about testing are being made by [state](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html) and [local](https://www.naccho.org/membership/lhd-directory) health departments or healthcare providers.
- If you have symptoms of Covid-19 and want to be tested, call your healthcare provider first.
- You can also visit your state or local health department's website to latest for the latest information on testing. 
- Although **supplies of tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find a place to get tested.**
### Results
- **If you test positive for Covid-19 by a viral test,** know what protective steps to take [if you are sick or caring for someone.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/index.html)
- **If you test negative for Covid-19 by a viral test,** you probably were not infected at the time your sample was collected. However, that does not mean you will get sick. The test result only means that you did not have Covid-19 at the time of testing.
If you test positive or negative, no matter the type of test, you should still take preventative measures to [protect yourself and others.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html)
